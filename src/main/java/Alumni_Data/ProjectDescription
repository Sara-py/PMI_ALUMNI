        This file is My Project's description.
- My goal in this Project is to gather a small basic data of all the graduates of a university.
-For your information, an ALUMNUS, is a student/person who have already graduated that educational institution.
-ALUMNI is just a plural for Alumnus.
-Here they are given 4 options:
*1st option will list all the Students data inputted here.
*2nd option is for newbies, who wants to add into the system.
*3rd option is for those who wants to update their data. For their knowledge, they can't update their name in this
if they want to update their name too, then they have to delete that previous user and enter their data all over again.
*That is why their is 4th option, If you want to delete your user.
Once you are done, just press the 5th option, to save your data in xml and exit.
                Thank you!!
